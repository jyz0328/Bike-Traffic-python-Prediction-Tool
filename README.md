# Bike-Traffic-python-Prediction-Tool
designed during my Purdue University period ,May 2022-August 2022
1. Designed and developed a prediction tool using python which helps in forecasting bike traffic during different time periods and recommended positions to install sensors for real time safety monitoring..
2. Developed the prediction model using multivariate linear regression model by analyzing relationships between daily weather forecast data (5 attributes including temperature, (low/high temperature and 
precipitation  and bicycle traffic using sklearn.
3. Implemented R square algorithm on calculating positions with predicted maximum traffic flow for installing sensors..
